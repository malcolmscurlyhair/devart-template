## First Post!

Progress!  Of sorts.  First check-in consists of a very simple implementation of the maze-building algorithm, using processing and Javascript.  Currently it just gets drawn on screen, at a configurable size.  I'm using the ![recursive-division method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_division_method "recursive-division method"), which is nicely described on Wikipedia.
