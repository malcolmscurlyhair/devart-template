## First Post!

Progress!  Of sorts.  First check-in consists of a very simple implementation of the maze-building algorithm, using processing and Javascript.  Currently it just gets drawn on screen, at a configurable size.  I'm using the recursive division method, which is nicely described on Wikipedia:

A sample result is here:

Next on the agenda:

- Introduce an agent that will navigate the maze.
- Have the maze extend automatically when the agent gets close to the edge.
- Render the maze in isometric 3D.
- Figure out how to make the canvas take up the entire browser window.
